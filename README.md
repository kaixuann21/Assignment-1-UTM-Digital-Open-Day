## Reflection
On 28 October 2025, I was very excited to attend the UTM Digital Open Day. I had gained useful informations from the industry talks on 
information systems and Digital Infrastructure & data engineering. These talks mentioned the importance of data-driven systems, digital 
infrastructure, and the plans for improvement to the UTM Smart application.

Besides attending the industry talk, I also explored various activities and some booths during the UTM Digital Open Day. These activities
were very interesting, which provided me valuable exposure to digital solutions, innovation initiatives, and the role of UTM Digital in supporting
the university’s digital ecosystem. In addition, my friends and I got a capybara water bottle by filling in the Google form; it was very cute! 

Last but not least, the UTM Digital Open Day is very helpful to enhance my understanding of information systems and digital transformation.
Thank you to the organisers and speakers for organising an insightful event.
